# Loading and working with data frames

> The following examples should explain how to import data frames and to work with the data contained within them. 

## Loading Data

We will use Steller sea lion (*Eumotopias jubatus*) data as an example.  These are weights, lengths, and girths (basically, under the arm/flipper pits) of sea lion pups about two months after birth as part of a tagging mark-recapture study.  These data were collected (in part by Dr. Gurarie) on five islands in the North Pacific.  

This is what sea lion pups look like:

This dataset is available on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.syracuse.edu/ultra/courses/_507578_1/cl/outline) as `SeaLions.csv`, or at [this link](SeaLions.csv).   Once you download it, you can use the File Explorer to determine its location and read it into R in a couple of ways:

1. **From the command line:** you can download the dataset and modify the following line of code:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
SeaLions <- read.csv("SeaLions.csv")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SeaLions <- read.csv("insert the directory instead of this sentence/SeaLions.csv")
```

A directory is another way to refer to a folder or, simply, a location of a data file on your computer. You can get the address of the directory if you open the folder where you saved the file through File Explorer, right-click on the navigation bar and select `Copy address as text` option. Note: If you copy and paste the file directory in, you **have to change the direction of the slashes** from `\` to `/`! 

Note that `csv` is a **text based** file type (Comma Separated Values) - it just means that commas between entries indicate separate columns.  When a program "reads" the file, it "knows" that a comma means the end of one column and the start of another one. You can save any Excel file as a `csv` using the **Save As** function. CSVs are by far the the most common and convenient file type used for loading into R.

2. Alternatively, you can import datasets into `R` using the `RStudio` point-and-click interface. To do this:

- 1. Navigate to the `Files` tab in the bottom right corner of RStudio
- 2. Click on `SeaLions.csv`
-  3. RStudio will prompt you to either view the file or import the dataset. You want to import, so hit `Import File`
-  4. A pop-up window will appear, showing you the preview of the data frame. Click `Import` and observe that your file is now loaded - it should have appeared in your Environment in the top right corner of RStudio. 

This method does the same exact thing as the line of code above. It will automatically input the proper code into the console and save your file to the environment. Note that by default the file will have the same name rather than a name you designate for it.

## Working with data frames

Look at some properties of this data file, with the following functions:

```{r}
is(SeaLions) # tells what type of files we have
names(SeaLions) # tells us the names of all the columns
head(SeaLions) # shows the first several rows of the dataframe
```

Use a `$` to extract a given column:

```{r}
Length <- SeaLions$Length
Weight <-SeaLions$Weight
Island <- SeaLions$Island
Sex <- SeaLions$Sex
```

# Summary Statistics 


Just about all data can be broken into **categorical data** or **continuous data**.   Continuous data is numeric, and you can calculate a bunch of familiar statistics (means, ranges, medians, etc.)

```{r}
range(Length) # range
median(Length) # median
mean(Length) # mean
var(Length) # variance
sd(Length) # standard deviation
```

Categorical data comes in discrete, countable sets of options, called **factors** or **levels**.  The best statistic for categorical data is just to count them.  That's done with the super useful `table()` function: 

```{r}
table(Sex)
table(Island)
table(Island, Sex)
```


# Graphical Summaries

**Categorical** and **Continuous** data are illustrated and analyzed in different ways.   

## Continuous data

**Continuous data** contains a lot of different values.  The best way to see the spread (*distribution*) of those data is with a histogram - the `hist()` functino:

```{r, echo = -1}
hist(Length)
```

<font color = "#2E8B57">

> **Exercise 1:**  Produce a histogram of the **Weight** of the sea lion pups.  Also, report the **minimum**, **maximum** and **mean** weight of the sea lion puops. Copy and paste that figure into a Word or Google document

</font>


## Categorical data

For categorical data, you want to represent the counts.  The best choices are bar charts: 

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, echo = -1}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
barplot(table(Sex))
barplot(table(Island))
```

Or pie charts (which are very rarely used in scientific analyses). 

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
pie(table(Island))
```
<font color = "2E8B57"> 
> **Exercise 2:**  Just enter the following code to make a barplot of *both* sex and island.  Copy paste the figure into a Word / Google document. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
barplot(table(Island, Sex))
```

</font>


##  Boxplot

A boxplot shows us relationships between a continuous variable (like Length/Weight/Girth) and a discrete variable (like Island/Sex).  The box contains the *median*, and 25% and 75% *quantiles* and shows points that are outside of an "extreme" range of 1.5 x the resepective interquantile range:

```{r, echo = -1}
boxplot(Length ~ Sex)
```

Which sex do you think is generally longer!?

<font color = "#2E8B57">

> **Exercise 3:**  Produce a boxplot of the **weight** of the sea lions against Islands.  Do you think there is a significant difference against Islands? 

</font>


## Scatterplot

Finally, a scatterplot shows us relationships between two continuous variables.  It is the easiest plot:

```{r, echo = -1}
par(las = 1, bty = "l", mar = c(4,4,1,1))
plot(Length, Weight)
```

# Linear models

At a basic level, we want to know what is the relationship between Weight and Length of sea lion pups.  Specifically, for each cm of length, how much more (on average ) does a sea lion weigh. 

In math, that's a straightforward equation:

$$Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i$$

Where: 

- $i$ is the individual (i.e. each row in the data frame)
- $Y$ is the **response** variable (here: weight)
- $X$ is the **predictor** variable (here: length)
- $\alpha$ is the intercept
- $\beta$ is the slope, more generally: the **regression coefficient**
- $\epsilon$ is the random bit that's "unexplained" 

## Fitting a linear model

Fitting a linear model is done with the simple (and powerful)  `lm()` function.  All we have to do is state which is the *response* and which is the *predictor* using the R notation `Y ~ X`.  

The output of this function is complicated, so weÄºl save it as a new object:

```{r}
Weight.lm <- lm(Weight ~ Length)
```

The output of just the linear model is: 

```{r}
Weight.lm
```

Which gives us an intercept and a slope:  

- The intercept  $\alpha = -59$  but we almost never care about the intercept 
- The slope is $\beta = 0.85$.  

*What are the units of this slope!?*


## Plotting a linear model

This is done with the `abline()` function:

```{r, echo = -1}
par(las = 1, bty = "l", mar = c(4,4,1,1))
plot(Length, Weight)
abline(Weight.lm)
```

You can make plots prettier in lots of different of ways!

```{r, echo = -1}
par(las = 1, bty = "l", mar = c(4,4,1,1))
plot(Length, Weight, pch = 19, cex =0.5)
abline(Weight.lm, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```


## Significance of linear model

This is nice!  But is the effect "significant"?  That means - is there an actual relationship between the two?  One way to test this is to look at **confidence intervals**, which are related to the **standard deviation**, and at **p-values**. 

All of this information is in a higher level of summary information provided by the **summary** command: 

```{r}
summary(Weight.lm)
```

There is lots to unpack here.  But basically, we look straight at the `Length` row.  The standard error is 0.02, so the confidence interval is  $0.85 \pm 2 \times 0.02 = \{0.81-0.89\}$.  That is a very narrow confidence interval!  Very far from "0".  The *p-value* column tells us *what is the probability that there is NO relationship between length and weight?*.  That probability is VERY VERY VERY VERY low.  So we can make a statement like:  *There is a*  ***significant** *relationship between length and weight of sea lion pups.*

# Analyzing sex differences

Here's an important question:  Do **male** and **female** show the same length-weight relationship?  We know that Steller sea lions are extremely **sexually dimorphic** (adult males are ~1000 kg, adult females closet to ~400 kg).  Is that dimorphism expressed at an early stage as well? 


## Subsetting data

To answer these questions, we need to learn how to subset the data.  This is done with **square brackets** `[]`, and **logical comparisons** (like equal to: `==` or greater than `>`, etc.).  

So, to pick out the length of the males and the females, you'd do 

```{r}
Weight.Male <- Weight[Sex == "M"]
Weight.Female <- Weight[Sex == "F"]
```

Now you can compare those means and standard deviations:

```{r}
mean(Weight.Male)
mean(Weight.Female)
```

## Statistical test of comparison

As a brief aside, if you want to statistically test whether there is a difference in the weight of male and female pups, you can do:

```{r}
t.test(Weight.Male, Weight.Female)
```


OR, also fit a linear model:

```{r}
summary(lm(Weight~Sex))
```

Lots of good information here we can review in class. 

## Perform the analysis

You now have all the tools to answer the question!
