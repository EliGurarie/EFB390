## What is a **ecological niche**? 

20th century ecologists developed a so-called **competitive exclusion principle**, which said that two organisms with the same needs in the same place cannot co-exist.  

.red["No 2 species of birds or mammals will be found to occupy precisely the same niche”]


[*Grinnell (1917) “The niche relationships of the California Thrasher”*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4072271) 
	

According to Grinnell: 

1. **First order determinant** is abiotic: physiology/temperature/precipitation/etc..

2. **Second order determinant** is ‘faunal’ – i.e., biotic interactions and especially competition.

## But niches can be very specific!

Seems like species can do a nice job of *partitioning* their niches.

## Grinell (1917) Niche

.large[

- Competition among species can be part of the ‘niche’
- Other resources (biotic, abiotic) and ‘space’ can also be part of the niche
- In this definition: ‘habitat’ (structure) is only part of the niche 


So: .Large.center[**habitat** < **niche**]
]

---

## Elton (1927) Niche

.pull-left-70[
Emphasizes the functional role of a species within a community (not where it lives, but what it does). 

So: **habitat** $\neq$ **niche**
 
- *Niche* is the **profession** of a species 
- *Habitat* is the **address** where that species actually lives.

>  "when an ecologist sees a badger, they should include in their thoughts some definitive idea of the animal's place in the community to which it belongs, just as if they had said 'there goes the vicar'".

For example: the **niche** filled by *birds of prey that eat small animals*
- In an oak wood this niche is "occupied" by **tawny owls**. 
- In open grassland it is "occupied" by **kestrels**.

## Niche concept underlies most **Species Distribution Modeling** (SDM)

.large[aka: **environmental (or ecological) niche modeling (ENM)** or simply **range mapping**]

.pull-left-30[
Large-scale mapping  of **Species Distributions** against covariates ... e.g. **temperature**, **precipitation**, **elevation**, **human impacts**, **landcover**, **vegetation**, etc. 

Very useful for making, e.g., climate change predictions.

## Fundamental vs. realized niche

- **fundamental** - what a species *could* be
- **realized** - where a species actually *is*

![](images/cthalmus.jpeg)

**Antarctica** is *not* polar bear habitat, but it **IS** polar bear fundamental niche!

## Niche summary
.pull-left[
- The concept of **niche** emerged to explain why animals exist and co-exist in particular areas AND behave in certain ways.  

- Under typical current usage:  **niche** is environmental/biological ‘space’, **habitat** occurs in geographic space. 

   - Niche is the ‘profession’ of a species….
   - Habitat is the ‘address’ of a species….


- Niche is a property of a *species*, habitat is property of an *individual* (or *subpopulation*) within Niche space.

- Niche is useful for modeling **global ranges**. 

- Habitat is useful for looking at **populations of interest** in **specific locations**.

## More important definitions

#### Habitat use

The way in which an individual or species uses habitat to meet its life history needs.

#### Habitat selection

The **process** involving decisions made by an animal about what habitat it would use.
Depends on **scale of selection**. 


]

.pull-right[
#### Habitat availability

The relative frequency of habitats that are *accessible* to an individual.  
 
#### Habitat utilization

The relative frequency of time spent in available habitats. 

#### Habitat preference

The disproportional use of some resources over others.
