## Demographic Stochasticity

.darkred[**Stochasticity**] means: **randomness** in **time**.  

***Demography*** is the **Science of Population Dynamics**. Often it refers specifically to **births** and **deaths** (and **movements** ... but we're still looking at closed population). 

Individually, *all* demographic processes are stochastic.  An individual has some **probability** of dying at any moment.  An individual has some *probability* of reproducing (or some probability distribution of number of offspring) at a given time.

.green[**Question:**] How important is the randomness of *individual* events for a *population* process?  

.green[**More specific Q:**] What is the probability of extinction?

On average, the number of individuals at time $t+1$ is the number that survived + the number that reproduced of those that survived.  

$$E(N_{t+1}) = p_s N_t + p_b\,p_s N_t = p_s (1+p_b) N_t$$

So (in our coin flip example) 
$$\widehat{\lambda} = p_s (1+p_b) = 0.75$$ 

**What does that mean for our population!?**

Even if the population growth is 0 (neither growing nor falling) ....

$$\widehat{\lambda} = 0.5 \times (1+1) = 1$$   

**demographic stochasticity** leads to *some* probability of extinction always.


### Main take-away

**Demographic stochasticity** is important only for *small* populations.

## Fundamental population equation

$$\huge \Delta N = B - D + I - E$$
.large[

Exponential growth assumes these (especially .red[**Birth**] & .red[**Death**]) are proportional to .red[**N**]. 

But at high N ... B can fall, or D can rise, or I can decrease or E can increase.  

]

### Density dependence

Means that the rate of a parameter, e.g. $b = {B\over N}$ is (a) NOT constant, and (b) dependent on total population (or density) $N$

## Example: Wolf populations

-	Dispersal into new area, mainly wolf mating pairs. 
-	Highly territorial! 
-	Wolves produce up to 4 pups per litter that survive
-	If there are no neighbors, wolves will disperse to found new packs
-	Pack with 8 adults or 2 adults, still produces (about) 4 pups per litter 
-	If there are lots of neighbors, packs become larger (more individuals) in smaller territories.

# Modeling wolf population

Population equation: 

$$N_t = (1 + b - d) \times N_{t-1}$$


Death rate is constant: $d = 0.25$

Birth rate is high when population is low:
$b_0 = 2$

Birth rate is small when population is high:
- $N = 1$; $B = 2$; $b = 2$
- $N = 8$; $B = 16$; $b = 2$

But it hits an absolute maximum of 16 total.  So if:
- $N = 32$; $B = 16$; $b = 1/2$
- $N = 64$; $B = 16$; $b = 1/4$

##  Some Concepts

- Natural populations are always eventually limited 

- The "cap" on a population is called the .darkred[***Carrying Capacity*** ] (symbol: **K**).  This is 

- When population rates (*b*, *d*, also *i*, *e*) depend on the **total population**, this is called: .darkred[***Density Dependence***]. 

- Growth that is is not **exponential** is called .darkred[***Logistic***]

- The maximum growth rate (max $b-d$) is called the .darkred[**intrinsic growth rate**].

- Calf / pup / juvenile mortality is highest when densities are highest.

- **Fecundity** (# of offspring per female) falls at high densities.
