## Population ecology is all about ... 

 $$\huge N$$

 but where?  when? 

--

## Here! Now! ..

$$\huge N_t$$

 but how many were there? 

---

## That many, then $\Delta t$ ago!

$$\Large N_t = N_{t - \Delta t} + \Delta N$$

slight rearrangement:

$$\Large N_{t+1} = N_t + \Delta N$$

For now, $\Delta t = 1$, i.e. it's the discrete unit that we measure population change.  VERY TYPICALLY - whether because of biology or field seasons:  $$\Delta t = 1\,\, \textrm{year}$$. 

---

## How does population change?

$$\Large N_{t+1} = N_t + (B - D) + (I - E)$$


### **B**irth
### **D**eath
### **I**mmigration
### **E**migration 

---
  
## Assumption 1: no one's getting on or off the bus

$$\Large N_{t+1} = N_t + B - D$$

### **B**irth
### **D**eath

### .red[**I**mmigration]
### .red[**E**migration]

This is a **closed population** ... 

---
  
## Assumption 2: the important one

The number of *Births* and *Deaths* is proportional to *N*.

$$\Large N_{t+1} = N_t + bN_t - dN_t$$
What does that mean? 

.pull-left[
- Every female gives birth to the same number of offspring? 
- Every female has the same *probability* of giving birth?  
- Every female has the same *probability* of giving birth to the same *distribution* of offspring? 
]

.pull-right[
- A fixed proportion of all individuals dies? 
- Every individual has the same *probability* of dying? 
- the *distribution* of probabilities of dying is constant? 
]

---

## Some math ....

Define $$r_0 = b - d$$

$r_0$: **discrete growth factor**,

$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_0 N_t$$
$$N_{t+1} = (1 + r_0) N_t$$



$$N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t$$



$\lambda$ is .blue[**rate of growth (or decrease)**]

- If $d > b$, $\lambda < 1$.  
- If $b > d$, $\lambda > 1$.

---
 
## Cranking this forward

$$N_{t+1} = \lambda(N_t)$$
$$N_{t+2} = \lambda(N_{t+1}) = \lambda^2 N_t$$
$$N_{t+3} = \lambda^3 N_t$$

Solution:

$$\large N_{t+y} = \lambda^y N_t$$
or 

$$\huge N_t = \lambda^t N_0$$

## Some examples

pars(); par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(3,3,3,2), las = 1)
lambdas <- c(1,1.1,1.15,1.2)
x <- 0:25
plot(x, x, ylim = c(0, 100), type = "n", xlab = "time", ylab = "count",
     main = expression(lambda >= 1))
cols <- c("darkgrey", "orange", "red", "darkred")
legend("topleft", col = cols, 
       pch = 19, legend = lambdas, bty, cex = 1.25)
for(i in 1:4) points(x, lambdas[i]^x, add = TRUE, 
                     col = cols[i], lwd = 2, pch = 19, type = "o")

lambdas <- c(1,0.95,0.9,0.8)
x <- 0:25
plot(x, x, ylim = c(0, 100), type = "n", xlab = "time", ylab = "count",

## How fast is exponential/geometric growth?

![](images/chess.jpg)

Legend says the inventor of chess (in India) so delighted the raja, he was offered anything he wanted. 

Inventor said, not much.  One grain of rice on one square, 2 on the next, 4 on the next and so on till the board is filled.

## Note what the log-scale does

```{r LambdaExamples, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}

lambdas <- c(2,1.2,1.1,1,0.95,0.9,0.8)
cols <- c("darkred", "red", "orange", "darkgrey", 
          "lightblue", "blue", "darkblue")

pars(); par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(3,3,3,2), las = 1)


N0 <- 10

x <- 0:25


x <- 0:25
plot(x, x, ylim = c(0, 200), type = "n", xlab = "time", ylab = "count", 
     main = "positive growth")
for(i in 1:length(lambdas)) points(x, N0*lambdas[i]^x, add = TRUE, 
                     col = cols[i], lwd = 2, pch = 19, type = "o")

legend("topright", col = cols, ncol = 2, 
       pch = 19, legend = lambdas, bty)

plot(x, x, ylim = c(1, 300), type = "n", xlab = "time", ylab = "count",
      log = "y", main = "log scale")

for(i in 1:length(lambdas)) points(x, N0*lambdas[i]^x, add = TRUE, 
                     col = cols[i], lwd = 2, pch = 19, type = "o")

## Estimating some rates ... discrete

.pull-left-30[![](images/seaotter_cute.jpg)]

.pull-right-70[

The amazing thing is, if you have an equation "solved", you only need 2 points on the curve to compute. 

Let's use the discrete equation: 

$$N_{t+y} = \lambda^y N_t$$
$$1000 = 60 \times \lambda^{40}$$
$$16.7 = \lambda^{40}$$
$$2.81 = 40 \times \log (\lambda)$$
$$0.07025 = \log (\lambda)$$
$$\lambda = \exp(0.07025) = 1.0728$$

i.e. population increase about $$7.28\%/year$$.
