### Accuracy

Is the estimate .blue[**biased**]?

Determined by **design**. 

Can be difficult to assess. 

--

### Precision

What is the .red[*error*] or .red[*variance*] or .red[*spread*] on the resulting estimate?   

Quantified with .green[**Confidence Intervals (C.I.)**] or .green[**Coefficients of Variation (C.V.)**]

Generally determined by **effort** and computed with **fancy statistics**. 

Generally **smaller** the bigger the **sample**.

### Very accurate, but very imprecise:

*“It could be anything ranging from **something that would endanger the lives of hundreds of millions** of people to something that **has no impact on anything whatsoever**. That’s how vague the classified categorization is,” Alex Wellerstein, a historian of science and nuclear weapons, told me.*]

---

### Goal

.large[
Increase both **accuracy** and **precision** 
- (maybe, generally, a higher premium on **accuracy** ... which is harder). 


***or***

Maybe it's just enough to know how things are *changing*.

### Total Count, aka. **Census**


.pull-left[
#### Pros

- Simple to explain!
- Simple math (*arithmetic*)!
- Very precise (no "confidence interval")

#### Cons

- Usually - VERY difficult to perform!
- Only possible for certain kinds of animals
- Accuracy?
