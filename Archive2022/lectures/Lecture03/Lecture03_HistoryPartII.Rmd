**Where:** around the world ... where land is "marginal", i.e. too upredictable / unproductive for intensive agriculture.  Usually **open** and **arid** land.

## In (feudal) Europe 

.pull-left-60[

Wild-lands were rapidly cultivated and developed.

Feudal system preserved remaining wilderness as strictly **property of the king**, with especial claim on "higher game", esp. **deer**, **boar**. 
  
**Poaching** strongly deterred  (hanging / blinding / maiming / etc.)

This conflicted with common-use of land, though small game (rabbit snaring, bird netting) remained legal. 

**Game Laws of England** (~1400) made wealth was a **legal prerequisite** to hunt.

Motivated several peasant rebellions.

## Back to the deep past future


.blockquote.small[Without climate stability ... it is unlikely that agriculture will be possible in the 21st century and beyond. Civilization will either collapse or gradually disappear over the coming centuries...

<br>


In the long run, the vision of **returning to a hunting and gathering way of life** is **wildly optimistic** ... Every characteristic that defines us as a species â€” compassion for unrelated others, intelligence, foresight and curiosity â€” evolved in the Pleistocene. **We became human as hunters and gatherers and we can regain our humanity when we return to that way of life.**]
