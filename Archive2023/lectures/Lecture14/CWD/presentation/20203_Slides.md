The Model (a description)
===

Recruitment
===

[equation]

The assumptions: 
1. Logistic density dependent growth, K = 2*(2019 pop)
2. Adult recruitment, r = ~0.5

Mortality
===

[equation]

Wolf and Non-Wolf: 
Non-wolf = Different CWD v. non-CWD?
Wolf = Allocated 1000 wolves by area to X counties with known wolf populations
Assume that deer are the main diet of wolves and some fixed number, approx. 40 killed/wolf/year
P (non-CWD killed) @ P(CWD) x P(non-CWD) x P(killed, given non-CWD)
Odds of CWD/non-CWD = alpha 
**alpha = selective predation coefficient** (completely unknown)

Disease dynamics
===

[equation]

Lambda = force of infection? (Allison?!)

Assumptions:
1. Perfectly mixed populations

Dispersal
===

[equation]

Exponential dispersal kernel with mean lambda

Estimable from movement data?

	Strategy
===

Constrain parameters set such that:

- Deer do not die out
- CWD persists

Look at infection rate and abundance contrasting counties with and w/o wolves

Results
===

- Equilibrium infection rate as function of alpha
- More to come


Parameters
= CWD deer deaths 0.09
= Mortality non-CWD deer = 0.05
# deer consumed/wolf/year = 72
= Adult recruitment = .4
Dispersal kernel = 40
Rate of infection = 0.38

Next steps
===

- Assess all assumptions through literature (and today's discussion)
	-- Literature review
	-- Density dependence?
	-- Disease transmission
	-- Mortality - modeling harvest?!
	-- More realistic wolf distribution level
- Thoroughly explore parameter space
- Fit to historical data!!
