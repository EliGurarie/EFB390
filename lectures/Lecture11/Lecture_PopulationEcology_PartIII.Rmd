## Nice theory you've got there, but ... 

- What about **trees**?  They're big, they're long-lived (very **K**), but they produce and disperse a **heckload** of seeds (very, very **r**).

- What about **iteroparous** fish species (**K**) that are hedging their bets against high inter-annual variation in environmental conditions (very **r**)?

## Body Condition and Physiology

**Fecundity** and **Survival** both depend very much on **body condition**. 

**Body condition** is measured in many ways, for example:.  

> .small[
We analysed two metrics of body condition: i) a direct subcutaneous **fat score (categorical, 1-5)**, assessed by palpating the belly-loin, with the badger laterally recumbent, and ii) a **body condition index (BCI)** estimated using a ratio-based approach for each capture: log (body mass)/log (body length).

## Influences on body condition

- **Food availability** - including (often) high seasonal variation

  - These relationships make **Body Condition** a good proxy for **Habitat Quality**

- **Disease and parasite loads**

- **Stress** - from human, predator impacts, or social interactions
]

.pull-right[
## Consequences of (poor) body condition

- Lower **survival** & lower **fecundity**
  - Varies by age
  - Often - physiological energetic trade-offs between **survival** and **reproduction** (less gonadal growth, later maturation, skipped estrus)
 
- Population level impacts
  - mechanisms of **Density Dependence**
